how did i make it?
for example:
`# text`
actually looks
# text
and `**text**`
becomes **text** and `*text*` becomes *text*
code yes, ```text``` with backsticks [download file](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1O70wQQVmxFEmRfWt63CW7qM1eKyhZlQe&export=download&authuser=0) -> you can upload files
***
and screenshots or images, for example:
<img width="32" height="32" alt="cursor-default" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c41410e1-2a90-4717-88f1-49396b750f22" />
